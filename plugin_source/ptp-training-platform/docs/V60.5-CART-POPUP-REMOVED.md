# PTP Training Platform v60.5.0 - Cart Popup Removed

## Summary
Removed the floating cart popup/slide-out panel. Users now go directly to the `/ptp-cart/` page for cart management and then to `/ptp-checkout/` for checkout.

## Changes

### 1. Cart Popup Disabled (class-ptp-unified-cart.php)

**Problem:** The floating cart button (FAB) and slide-out panel added visual clutter and created a confusing dual cart experience.

**Fix:** Completely disabled the popup in `render_cart_widget()` method. The method now returns immediately without rendering any HTML.

```php
public function render_cart_widget() {
    // Cart popup completely disabled in v60.5.0
    // Users now go directly to /ptp-cart/ page for cart management
    return;
}
```

### 2. Header Cart Icon Updated

**Before:** Button that opened JavaScript popup
```html
<button onclick="if(window.PTPUnifiedCart) PTPUnifiedCart.open();">
```

**After:** Link that navigates to cart page
```html
<a href="/ptp-cart/">
```

### 3. Cart Icon Shortcode Updated

The `[ptp_cart_icon]` shortcode now renders a link to `/ptp-cart/` instead of a button that opens a popup.

## User Flow (After v60.5.0)

1. **Add to Cart** → Item added, user stays on page
2. **Click Cart Icon** → Navigate to `/ptp-cart/` page
3. **View Cart** → Full cart page with items, quantities, upsells
4. **Proceed to Checkout** → Navigate to `/ptp-checkout/` page
5. **Complete Order** → Enter details, pay, get confirmation

## Benefits

- **Simpler UX**: Single cart experience instead of popup + page
- **Better Mobile**: Full-page cart works better on mobile devices
- **Cleaner Code**: Removes ~1000 lines of popup HTML/CSS/JS
- **Faster Load**: No popup assets loaded on every page

## Files Changed

- `includes/class-ptp-unified-cart.php` - Disabled popup, updated cart icons to link
